# TuteeTally User Guide

TuteeTally is a **desktop app for managing student contacts for private tutors, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TuteeTally can make student
management much easier and faster than traditional GUI apps.

The system includes features for adding students, viewing student details, viewing summary statistics, and deleting student entries. <br>

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>
* Command words such as `add`, `delete` etc. are case-sensitive.<br>
   e.g. `Add` `ADD` `aDD` are invalid for the add command

* Words in `{UPPER_CASE}` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `-name/{NAME}`, `NAME` is a parameter that can be used as `add -name John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-name {NAME} -address {ADDRESS}`, `-address {ADDRESS} -name {NAME}` is also acceptable.
* Prefixes for parameters need to have a space before the `-`. <br>
e.g. `add -name Xiao Ming -address 13, Computing Dr, 117417 -email xiaoming@email.com -phone 88888888 -subject Math` is valid, but `add-name Xiao Ming-address 13, Computing Dr, 117417-email xiaoming@email.com-phone 88888888-subject Math` is not.
* All id inputs in commands labelled `{ID}` can omit any leading 0s.<br>
e.g. `1`, `01`, `000000001` are all valid id inputs for the ID `#000001` as leading 0s are ignored.

* All `{ID}` are by default a positive integer of maximum ***6 digits*** excluding leading 0s. Any ID that exceeds a positive 6 digit integer number (e.g. 1234567) may cause errors. However, 000000999999 is still a valid ID.

* The maximum number of students that can be stored in TuteeTally is 999999.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Enhanced Payment Management

TuteeTally's payment management commands are designed to streamline the financial interactions between tutors and students, ensuring accuracy and transparency. Below are detailed explanations of each command's purpose and benefits:

### Adding a Payment: `addpayment`

Record new payments easily with the `addpayment` command, keeping track of what each student owes. This command simplifies the maintenance of financial records, ensuring you never overlook an outstanding payment.

**Format:** `addpayment -id {ID} -payment {AMOUNT}`

**Example:**
* `addpayment -id 000001 -payment 150` or `addpayment -id 1 -payment 150` would add a payment of 150 to the student with ID #000001 if it exists. <br>

After entering the command, the interface will update as shown below:

![Add Payment Update Display](images/payment/add_payment.jpg) _The display showing "Payment owed: $150.00" after adding a payment._

### Marking Payment of the student: `markpayment`

The `markpayment` command allows you to update the status of a student's payment to reflect payments that have been made. This feature helps maintain a clear record of completed transactions, building trust and transparency. <br>

**Format:** `markpayment -id {ID} -payment {AMOUNT}`

**Example:**
* `markpayment -id 000001 -payment 100` or `markpayment -id 1 -payment 100` with ID #000001 if it exists. <br>

After entering the command, the interface will update as shown below: <br>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** <br>
* If the amount marked as paid exceeds the total outstanding payment, the total outstanding payment will be set to 0. <br>

</box>

### Resetting all Payments of the student: `resetpayments`
<box type="info" seamless>

**For your information:** <br>
The command `resetpayments` intentionally includes an 's' after `payment` because it is designed to reset all owed payments for a student. <br>
</box>

Use the `resetpayments` command to clear a student's outstanding payment amount, useful for starting anew or correcting mistakes. This command ensures your financial records remain accurate and up-to-date.<br>

**Format:** `resetpayments -id {ID}`

**Example:**
* `resetpayments -id 000001` or `resetpayments -id 1` would reset the payment for the student with ID #000001 if it exists.

After entering the command, the interface will update as shown below: <br>

![Reset Payments Update Display](images/payment/reset_payments.jpg) _The display showing "No payment owed" after resetting payments, with $50.00 owed previously._

| Field              | Prefix        | Required | Caveats                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|---------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unique ID**      | `-id`         | Yes      | Unique ID must be a positive integer with a maximum length of 6 digits excluding leading zeros. <br> Leading zeros are optional. For example, `1`, `01`, and `000000001` are all valid representations for the ID #000001. IDs between `1` and `999999` (inclusive) are considered valid. |
| **Hours**          | `-hours`      | Yes      | Hours need not be an integer input to give you more flexibility. Values like `2 hours 45 mins`, `2+ hours` are valid as well.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Content**        | `-content`    | Yes      | Content should be a string, special characters are allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Learning Style** | `-style`      | Yes      | Learning style should be a string, special characters are allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Notes**          | `-notes`      | Yes      | Notes should be a string, special characters are allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:**<br>

* Even though the prefixes are compulsory, their content can be left blank (except ID). <br>
* Example: `log -id 000001 -hours -content -style -notes` adds a log with blank `hours`, `content`, `style` and `notes` field.

</box>

**Example:** <br>
* `log -id 000001 -hours 2 -content English Comprehension -style Visual -notes Great improvement!` would log a lesson for the student with ID #000001 noting that he/she has had a great improvement in English Comprehension, it also logs the learning style of the student. <br>

After entering the command, the interface will update as shown below: <br>

![Log Update Display](images/log/log.jpg) _The display reflects the successful logging for the student with ID #000001._

**Tip:**<br>

* After successful addition, you can check your updated log list using the `view -id {ID}` command! <br>
* Do remember to close the tab before you add or view a different student's logs. This will ensure the log tab refreshes properly.

</box>

After entering the `view -id 000001` command, the interface will update as shown below: <br>

### Editing the data file

TuteeTally's data is saved automatically as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/tuteetally.json`. Do proceed carefully if you intend to edit this file directly.

<box type="caution" seamless>

* Certain edits can cause the TuteeTally to behave in unexpected and magical ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range, or invalid characters are added). 
* Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly. 
* It's up to you to ensure the validity of the data if you choose to edit it.
* Hence, it is recommended to make a backup of the file (by copying and pasting to another location) before editing it.<br>

## Known issues

1. **Multi-Screen Usage Issue**: When transitioning from using multiple screens to only the primary screen, the application's GUI may appear off-screen if it was previously moved to a secondary display. To resolve this issue, delete the `preferences.json` file and restart the application. <br>

2. **Payment Rounding Display**: Payment amounts are displayed rounded to the nearest cent ($0.01). For example, an entry of `$0.001` will be shown as `$0.00`. However, the application accurately tracks and records the exact amounts entered. <br>

3. **Zero Balance Command Entry**: If a student's balance is already $0, entering a `markpayment` or `resetpayments` command is permitted, but no changes will be made. <br>

4. **Maximized View Anomaly**: When the application is maximized, an empty white block may appear at the bottom of the screen. <br>

5. **Student Log Viewing**: When a student with no logs is viewed, an empty white block is displayed. <br>

6. **Summary Stats Window Precision**: The Summary Stats Window displays exact values with more than two decimal places. For example, a payment of `$100.50` owed by students will be shown as `$100.500000`. <br>

7. **Adding New Logs**: If a previous log window for a student remains open and new logs are added, the log window must be reopened using the command `view -id {ID}` to reflect the updates. <br>

8. **Command Input Flexibility**: Commands such as `addexam` and `deleteexam` accept inputs both with and without spaces between the prefix and the input, e.g., `addexam -id{ID} -exam{EXAMNAME} -date{DATE}`. However, the GUI error messages may incorrectly suggest that spaces are required. All commands, except `view -name {NAME}`, can be used flexibly with or without space between prefixes and inputs.
