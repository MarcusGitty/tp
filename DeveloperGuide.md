## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### View all feature

#### Implementation

The mechanism is similar to list feature in `AddressBook`. parser checks for `-all` flag and execute showing the entire list of students.

The feature can return user to the whole list after user uses view -id/view -name function to see specific student. A list of students will only be displayed if there are at least 1 student added to TuteeTally.

Below is a sequence diagram of how view all interacts with multiple classes.

<puml src="diagrams/ViewAllSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ViewAllSequenceDiagram" />

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How view all executes:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** In a view command class with view -id/-name.
    * Pros: Clear execution line.
    * Cons: Several if else checks, more prone to errors.

* **Alternative 2:** Separate classes for each view command
    * Pros: Easy to implement, less merge conflicts.
    * Cons: Large number of files and parsers needed.

### View student feature
The `view` command is a feature that allows the user to find details related to student(s) and retrieve their details.
It consists of 3 variants
1. `view -all` : shows all students currently recorded in TuteeTally.
2. `view -name`: shows all students recorded with their name, or part of their name matching the input.
2. `view -id` : finds (unique) student associated with the unique id.
3. `view -stats` : opens a popup for summary statistics with regard to all students.
#### Proposed Implementation
The checking of which variant of `view` is triggered is detected based on the presence of prefixes in `ViewCommandParser#parse`.

If more than one valid prefix `-all`, `-name`, `-id`, or `stats` are present, `ViewCommandParser` creates `ViewCommands` in the following order of precedence:
* `all` > `name` > `id` > `stats`

Below is an example usage scenario where the `view -stats` command was entered.

**Step 1:** User first calls `view -stats`. The input is passed into ``AddressBookParser`` which instantiates a ``ViewCommandParser`` instance.
The `ViewCommandParser` uses ``ViewCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent`` to check for presence of the ``-add`` prefix.

<puml src="diagrams/ViewParserSequenceDiagram0.puml" />

**Step 2:** The check for ``-add`` prefix returns false, and a similar check routine for prefixes is carried out for ``-name`` and ``-id``
<puml src="diagrams/ViewParserSequenceDiagram1.puml" />

**Step 3:** All checks for prefixes return false, and falls into the default case. A ``CommandResult`` with the ``isStatsCommand`` set to true is returned
<puml src="diagrams/ViewParserSequenceDiagram2.puml" />

For the prefixes ``-name`` and ``-id``, a filtered list containing the search results will be returned.
Both variants utilize a similar logic to of passing in a ``prefix`` to ``model#updateFilteredPersonList`` to adjust the entries displayed by the GUI.
<puml src="diagrams/ViewIdSequenceDiagram.puml" />

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How to check which command to execute:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Goes through checks for presence of prefix variants, and execute the first detected based on the precedence of ``-all`` > ``-name`` > ``-id`` > ``-stats``
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: If variants increase in the future, might take extra time falling through the conditional checks. Precedence of prefixes can also not be aligned with what the user intended.

* **Alternative 2:** Executes all variants given in the command
  itself.
    * Pros: More intuitive for user, gives quick overview of multiple view commands.
    * Cons: Difficult to implement and requires drastic changes in GUI.
