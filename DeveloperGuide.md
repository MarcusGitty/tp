## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" alt="Model Class Diagram of the Person" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

The Commons package in the `seedu.address` contains classes that are shared across various components of the application. 
This ensures that common functionalities are easily accessible across the system and thus promote code reuse. This also simplifies the task of 
updating or enhancing functionality in one place. 

Below is a breakdown of the main categories within this package:

-`Core`
This category includes essential classes that are central to the application's operation:

    -Config: Manages configuration settings of the application, such as file paths and application-level settings. 
            It helps in maintaining a flexible codebase that can adapt to different deployment environments without requiring code changes.

    -GuiSettings: Holds GUI configuration details which can be serialized for persistence across sessions. This class includes settings such as window size, window position, and other UI-related preferences that enhance the user's experience by maintaining a consistent application state.

    -LogsCenter: Provides a central management facility for logging messages throughout the application. It configures the logging libraries and specifies the uniform format and logging levels, making the debugging process and monitoring of runtime behaviors more systematic.


- `Exceptions`
This category defines custom exceptions that handle specific error situations unique to the application:
  
- `Util`
Utility classes that provide helper functions and shared functionalities used by multiple components:

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### View student feature
The `view` command is a feature that allows the user to find details related to student(s) and retrieve their details.
It consists of 3 variants
1. `view -all` : shows all students currently recorded in TuteeTally.
2. `view -name`: shows all students recorded with their name, or part of their name matching the input.
2. `view -id` : finds (unique) student associated with the unique id.
3. `view -stats` : opens a popup for summary statistics with regard to all students.
#### Implementation
The checking of which variant of `view` is triggered is detected based on the presence of prefixes in `ViewCommandParser#parse`.

If more than one valid prefix `-all`, `-name`, `-id`, or `stats` are present, `ViewCommandParser` creates `ViewCommands` in the following order of precedence:
* `all` > `name` > `id` > `stats`

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How to check which command to execute:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Goes through checks for presence of prefix variants, and execute the first detected based on the precedence of ``-all`` > ``-name`` > ``-id`` > ``-stats``
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: If variants increase in the future, might take extra time falling through the conditional checks. Precedence of prefixes can also not be aligned with what the user intended.

* **Alternative 2:** Executes all variants given in the command
  itself.
    * Pros: More intuitive for user, gives quick overview of multiple view commands.
    * Cons: Difficult to implement and requires drastic changes in GUI.

Below is an example usage scenario where the `view -stats` command was entered.

**Step 1:** User first calls `view -stats`. The input is passed into ``AddressBookParser`` which instantiates a ``ViewCommandParser`` instance.
The `ViewCommandParser` uses ``ViewCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent`` to check for presence of the ``-add`` prefix.

<puml src="diagrams/ViewParserSequenceDiagram0.puml" />

**Step 2:** The check for ``-add`` prefix returns false, and a similar check routine for prefixes is carried out for ``-name`` and ``-id``
<puml src="diagrams/ViewParserSequenceDiagram1.puml" />

**Step 3:** The check for ``-stats`` return true, and a ``StatCommmand`` instance is returned to the ``LogicManager``.
The ``LogicManager`` then executes ``StatCommand`` which returns a  ``CommandResult`` with the ``isStatsCommand`` set to true.
<puml src="diagrams/ViewParserSequenceDiagram2.puml" />

For the prefixes ``-name`` and ``-id``, a filtered list containing the search results will be returned.
Both variants utilize a similar logic to of passing in a ``prefix`` to ``model#updateFilteredPersonList`` to adjust the entries displayed by the GUI.
<puml src="diagrams/ViewIdSequenceDiagram.puml" />

### View all feature

#### Implementation

The mechanism is similar to list feature in `AddressBook`. parser checks for `-all` flag and execute showing the entire list of students.

The feature can return user to the whole list after user uses view -id/view -name function to see specific student. A list of students will only be displayed if there are at least 1 student added to TuteeTally.

Below is a sequence diagram of how view all interacts with multiple classes.

<puml src="diagrams/ViewAllSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ViewAllSequenceDiagram" />

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How view all executes:**
* **Alternative 1:** In a view command class with view -id/-name.
    * Pros: Clear execution line.
    * Cons: Several if else checks, more prone to errors.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice) :** Separate classes for view -all and other view commands
    * Pros: Easy to implement, less merge conflicts.
    * Cons: More files and parsers needed.


### View Stats feature
This feature supports the viewing of summary statistics, it currently shows the total number of students, the total amount
owed by them and the number of exams in the upcoming months.

#### Implementation
It's mechanism is similar to the `help` feature where a popout window is shown when called.

It gets it's info from the `logic` interface

### View Name Feature
** to add in v1.4**
#### Implementation
** to add in v1.4**
### View ID Feature
** to add in v1.4**
#### Implementation
** to add in v1.4**

# Student Payment Management System

## Introduction

This section of the developer guide covers the functionalities provided for managing student payments. It includes adding payments, marking payments as paid, and resetting payment statuses for students. These features are integral to maintaining accurate and up-to-date financial records for each student.

### Features Overview

- **Add Payment**: Allows the addition of payment records to student accounts using unique identifiers.
- **Mark Payment**: Marks payments as completed for students, indicating that a payment has been made.
- **Reset Payments**: Resets the payment status of students, useful in scenarios where the total payment amount is fulfilled or adjustments are needed.

## Add Payment Feature

The `AddPaymentCommand` enables users to add payment records to students by specifying a unique student ID and the payment amount.
<puml src="diagrams/AddPaymentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddPaymentSequenceDiagram" />


### Implementation

1. The user inputs a command with the `-addpayment` flag, followed by the student's `uniqueId` and the amount.
2. The system parses this command, extracting the necessary details.
3. A new payment record is created and added to the student's account in the system.
   <puml src="diagrams/AddPaymentActivityDiagram.puml" alt="AddPaymentActivityDiagram" />

## Mark Payment Feature

### Implementation

1. The user inputs a command with the `-markpayment` flag, followed by the student's `uniqueId`.
2. The system identifies the corresponding student record and updates the payment status to reflect that it has been paid.
3. A confirmation is returned to the user upon successful update.
   <puml src="diagrams/MarkPaymentActivityDiagram.puml" alt="MarkPaymentActivityDiagram" />


## Reset Payments Feature

This feature enables the system to reset the payment status of students, which is useful when a student has fully paid their dues or when adjustments to their payment records are needed.
<puml src="diagrams/ResetPaymentsSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ResetPaymentsSequenceDiagram" />


### Implementation

1. A specific command with the `-resetpayments` flag and the student's `uniqueId` is issued by the user.
2. The system locates the student's record and resets the payment information, clearing any completed payments or dues.
3. A success message is sent to the user, confirming the reset.
   <puml src="diagrams/ResetPaymentsActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ResetPaymentsActivityDiagram" />

2. Improve the UI such as removing all white spaces from it.
3. Learning styles can be tagged to Person so that it doesn't need to be logged every lesson.
4. Logging of a lesson will automatically update the payment info.
5. View -id or -name should automatically filter and show the exams of the person on the right.
6. Log window will update its content to respond to addition of logs to a student.
7. Log entry can be deleted and its fields can be edited, including editing the date and time of the log to a custom date to match the lesson time.
8. Implement checking of duplicate persons to ensure the same person is not recorded multiple times.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` to support JavaFx.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  System should provide quick responses to user commands.
5.  Should have user-friendly design for interface, so it is intuitive to use.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS

##### Prerequisites
- User must be logged in with sufficient privileges to add payments.
- The student account associated with the given unique identifier must exist within the system.

##### Usage
- **To add a payment with a numerical amount**:
  `addpayment -id ID -amount 100.00`
  **Expected Outcome**: A payment of $100.00 is added to the student's account identified by `ID`. The system confirms the addition with a success message and updates the student's payment history accordingly.

#### Marking a Student's Payment

- **Command**: `markpayment`
- **Description**: Marks a specified payment as complete for a student's account. This command is used to update the status of a student's payments to reflect that they have been successfully processed or received.

##### Prerequisites
- User must be logged in with sufficient privileges to mark payments as complete.
- The student account associated with the given unique identifier must exist and have outstanding payments.

##### Usage
- **To mark a payment as complete**:
  `markpayment -id ID -payment PAYMENT_AMOUNT`
  **Expected Outcome**: The payment identified by `PAYMENT_AMOUNT` for the student `ID` is marked as complete. The system updates the payment status and provides a confirmation message.

#### Extensions and Error Handling
- **Invalid ID**: If an invalid `ID` or `PAYMENT_AMOUNT` is provided, the system will return an error message indicating the issue and suggesting corrective actions.
- **No Outstanding Payments**: If there are no outstanding payments to mark as complete, the system will notify the user accordingly.
- **Permission Denied**: If the user attempts to execute a command without sufficient privileges, the system will deny the request and provide an appropriate warning message.

### Additional Notes
- These commands are designed to interact seamlessly with the system's payment management module, ensuring accurate tracking and reporting of student payment statuses.
- Always ensure that the unique identifiers (`ID` and `PAYMENT_AMOUNT`) are correctly entered to avoid discrepancies or errors in payment processing.

#### Resetting Payments for a Student Account

- **Command**: `resetpayments`
- **Description**: Resets the payment status for all recorded payments in a specified student's account. This command is used when a student's payment record needs to be cleared, typically after all dues have been settled or in case of account adjustments.

##### Prerequisites
- User must be logged in with sufficient privileges to reset payment records.
- The student account associated with the given unique identifier must exist and have one or more payments recorded.

##### Usage
- **To reset all payments for a student**:
  `resetpayments -id ID`
  **Expected Outcome**: All payments recorded for the student account identified by `ID` are reset. The system confirms the reset with a success message, indicating that the student's payment history is now cleared.

#### Extensions and Error Handling
- **Invalid ID**: If an invalid `ID` is provided, the system will return an error message indicating that the student account could not be found.
- **No Recorded Payments**: If the student account does not have any recorded payments, the system will notify the user that there are no payments to reset.
- **Permission Denied**: Similar to the other commands, if the user attempts to execute the `resetpayments` command without sufficient privileges, the system will deny the request and display an appropriate warning message.

### Additional Notes
- Use the `resetpayments` command with caution, as it will clear all payment records for the specified student, potentially impacting their payment history and account status.
- Ensure accuracy when entering the `ID` to avoid unintentional resets of payment information for the wrong student account.
